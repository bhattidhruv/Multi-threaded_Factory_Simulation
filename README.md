# Multi-threaded_Factory_Simulation
This is a simulaiton of a Production plant, and the prodcution of the products are optemized with the help of **Multi-threaded Programming**.
### Factory Operation rules

Here I have designed and developed a program to simulate the product's part production line and assembly line. 
Factors included in the simulation were:
1. Time to produce parts
2. Time taken by part worker to carry produced parts from production line to the exchange area.
3. Time taken by the assembly worker to carry parts from exchnage area to assembly line.
4. Time taken for assembling the product.
###  Code Functions
There are 2 different versions of the simualtion.
1. Centralized Blocking 
2. Decentralized

### Final Output
Below are the output file of the factory production log.

Above image is the screenshot of the output text file (Log) with final production number of decentralized blocking.
